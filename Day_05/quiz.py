Diogo Dalot fired the 12-time winners into a 22nd-minute lead with a fine curling strike after the impressive Marcus Rashford had a shot blocked.

Rasmus Hojlund's diving header clipped the bar, Rashford had an attempt fumbled against the post by Wigan goalkeeper Sam Tickle and Alejandro Garnacho's well-hit 20-yard effort also bounced off the woodwork as United pushed for a second.

Martial Godo failed to make a clean connection from six yards to waste a rare chance of an equaliser for the hosts before United secured the victory in the second half.

Bruno Fernandes won a penalty, with his foot clipped by Liam Shaw's challenge, before the Portuguese midfielder got up to convert from the spot for United's second goal.

The draw for the fourth round took place just before kick-off and Manchester United will play at either Newport County, 18th in League Two, or non-league Eastleigh - 11th in the National League and the second-lowest ranked side remaining.

Those clubs will have a replay next week after it ended 1-1 at the weekend in south Wales, with round four taking place over the last weekend of January.
